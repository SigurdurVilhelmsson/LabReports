# ====================================================================
# FRONTEND ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES (.env)
# ====================================================================
# These variables are embedded into the client-side JavaScript bundle
# at build time. Never put secrets here - they will be publicly visible!
# ====================================================================

# ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING ⚠️
# NEVER put API keys in VITE_ prefixed environment variables!
# They will be exposed in the client-side bundle and can be stolen.
# API keys MUST be stored server-side only (see server/.env)
# See KVENNO-STRUCTURE.md Section 3 for security requirements.

# Backend API Endpoint (REQUIRED for production)
# This tells the frontend where to send API requests
# The backend server securely stores the Claude API key
VITE_API_ENDPOINT=https://kvenno.app/api

# For local development with backend server:
# VITE_API_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8000/api

# Application Mode
# Options: "dual" (both teacher and student), "teacher", "student"
VITE_APP_MODE=dual

# Base Path Configuration (REQUIRED for multi-year deployment)
# Set this BEFORE building for each deployment path
# Examples:
# - 2nd year: VITE_BASE_PATH=/2-ar/lab-reports/
# - 3rd year: VITE_BASE_PATH=/3-ar/lab-reports/
# See KVENNO-STRUCTURE.md Section 1 for complete deployment structure
VITE_BASE_PATH=/2-ar/lab-reports/

# Azure AD Authentication (for future implementation)
# These are PUBLIC values (client ID, tenant ID) - safe to expose
# See KVENNO-STRUCTURE.md Section 2 for authentication details
# VITE_AZURE_CLIENT_ID=your-azure-client-id
# VITE_AZURE_TENANT_ID=your-azure-tenant-id
# VITE_AZURE_REDIRECT_URI=https://kvenno.app/2-ar/lab-reports/

# ====================================================================
# DEVELOPMENT ONLY - DIRECT API MODE (NOT FOR PRODUCTION)
# ====================================================================
# Uncomment ONLY for local development without backend server
# ⚠️ NEVER use this in production or commit with real API key ⚠️
# VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_development_api_key_here
